I start with curated newsletters. My favorite is [Hacker Newsletter](https://hackernewsletter.com/). Sometimes I'm doing a search and find something interesting. Sometimes it's links in an article from a writer I already follow.

The flow basically looks like this:

If there is a Now page, I read the Now page. If there is an About page, I read the About page. If there is a Start Here page, I read the Start Here page. After that I visit the homepage.

What I'm looking for is more than one article that looks good. If I find three or four that look interesting, I'll probably add the site to my RSS reader.

An example from a recent sleuthing: [Gerg Orosz](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/) has written a blog for about six years, he's authored three books, and recently [started a newsletter](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/coming-soon). I wanted to find if Greg had written anything about the publishing of his books. I started with this google search `site:blog.pragmaticengineer.com writing books`. That lead me to his article called [Undervalued Software Engineering Skills: Writing Well](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/on-writing-well/). In that article he linked to a tweet where he listed a few authors talking about writing.

- [It's time to start writing](https://alexnixon.github.io/2019/12/10/writing.html) by Alex Nixon
- [Writing is Thinking](https://blog.stephsmith.io/learning-to-write-with-confidence/) by Steph Smith
- [Writing Is Thinking](https://boz.com/articles/writing-thinking) by Andrew Bosworth

I didn't find what I was looking for on Greg's site, but I did fine three new blogs that might find a home in my [RSS reader](/web-feeds/).
