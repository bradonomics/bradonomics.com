Zine recently signed up for health insurance through healthcare.gov. I have spent hours reading documentation and calling banks. I started with a list of questions. Some I have found answers for, the below remain unanswered.

1. How to pay for medical expenses with an HSAâ€”how do you actually use this?
1. What happens to the money in your HSA if you no longer have an high deductible insurance plan?

Do you know how this works? Please get in touch if you know some resources that can answer these.
