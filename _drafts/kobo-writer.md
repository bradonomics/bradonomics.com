I've been looking for a replacement for a broken Alphasmart NEO. The only real competitor I've seen is the [Freewrite Traveler](https://getfreewrite.com/products/freewrite-traveler), but at $500, I find it too expensive.

Today I saw this: [Kobo Writer](https://github.com/olup/kobowriter). Since I can get a used Kindle for about $30-40, I've never considered a Kobo Reader since their [cheapest option is $100](https://us.kobobooks.com/collections/ereaders). But if I could use it to write also, it might be worth it.

Another drawback: Kobo only has touch screen devices.

Another drawback: Kobos are all backlit.

I wonder if this same thing could be achieved with a Kindle?
