This is a boilerplate project and is intended to be built on, not used as-is.

It adds shopping cart functionality to Jekyll websites using [simpleCart(js)](http://simplecartjs.org/). Instructions for using it are in the [README file](https://github.com/bradonomics/jekyll-cart/blob/master/README.md). I created a walk-through video to explain how to use this repo:
