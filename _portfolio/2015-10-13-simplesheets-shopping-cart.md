notes: |
  SimpleSheets came to be after a conversation with Dr. Michael Shafer, the founder of [Warm Heart](http://warmheartworldwide.org/). Dr. Shafer said that many of the people his foundation was meant to help were having a hard time selling their wares. He said WooCommerce was "too much system" for these people as they had little schooling and even less computer skills.

  [Sheetrock.js](http://chriszarate.github.io/sheetrock/) is used to fetch the products from a Google Spreadsheet and [Handlebars.js](http://handlebarsjs.com/) is used to display them inside the HTML document. <a href="https://github.com/wojodesign/simplecart-js">simpleCart<sup>(js)</sup></a> is the eCommerce engine and does all the heavy lifting.
