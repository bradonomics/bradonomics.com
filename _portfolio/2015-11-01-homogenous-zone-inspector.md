client: eTest Network, LLC
build_year: '2015'
code_url: https://github.com/bradonomics/homogenous-zone-inspector/
requirements: |
  Allow customers to submit mold and asbestos inspection jobs via a form on the website. Have that submission stored in WordPress as a custom post type. Allow that data to be read and written to via a mobile app. If mobile device is offline, data changes should be stored locally and pushed to server when internet connection returns.
notes: |
  The client was inspecting homes in rural areas of the Rocky mountains where internet was spotty. Existing plugins were included to quickly show proof of concept. In the end the client pulled out and the project halted.

This project was designed to allow customers to submit mold and asbestos inspection jobs, have that submission stored in WordPress as a custom post type, and allow that data to be read and written to via a mobile app. We included existing plugins to quickly show proof of concept, but in the end the client pulled out and the project halted. It was fun while it lasted.
