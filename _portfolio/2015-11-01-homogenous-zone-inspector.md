This project was designed to allow customers to submit mold and asbestos inspection jobs, have that submission stored in WordPress as a custom post type, and allow that data to be read and written to via a mobile app. We included existing plugins to quickly show proof of concept, but in the end the client pulled out and the project halted. It was fun while it lasted.
