  Build the HTML and CSS files provided by the designer into a WordPress theme using the Genesis Framework.

This project was built on WordPress using the Genesis Framework. Tarmo, the designer, did the PSD-to-HTML conversion and turned over the code to me to build on WordPress. I also setup the server on Media Temple and configured WordPress.

Below are some screenshots of the original design.
