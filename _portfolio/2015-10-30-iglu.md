  Build the HTML and CSS files provided by the designer into a WordPress theme using the Genesis Framework. Include a job board using custom post types.
---

This project was built using the Genesis Framework. Tarmo, the designer, did the PSD-to-HTML/CSS conversion and turned over the code to me to build on the Genesis Framework. It included a job board which I built with a custom post type. We tried a few plugins in the beginning, but everything was a bit overkill for the requirements.

Below are some screenshots of the original design.
