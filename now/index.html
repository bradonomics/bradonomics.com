  <h2 id="work">Work</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Took a six-month contract to work with Leidos building the <a href="https://telehealth.hhs.gov/">Health Resources and Services Administration’s Telehealth website</a>.</li>
  <li>I started learning Ruby on Rails about a year ago. Last November I started building <a href="https://portholes.app/">Portholes</a>, an alternative to <a href="https://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a>.</li>
  <li>Still trying to decide if I want to put effort into a web agency; and if so, what products or services to offer.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="cycling">Cycling</h2>

<p>I started cycling in the summer of 2017, mostly to rehab my knee after surgery. After my knee was stronger, I returned to jiu-jitsu the following summer and continued riding as a way of increasing my cardiovascular fitness. Those rides were about 4 miles. In the summer of 2020, COVID kept me off the jiu-jitsu mats so I started longer rides—about 10 miles. The longer rides have continued this summer.</p>

<h2 id="reading-recommendations">Reading Recommendations</h2>

<p>I have long believed that book recommendations is an unsolvable problem. <a href="https://www.thestorygraph.com/">StoryGraph</a> is taking a stab at it and looks promising.</p>
