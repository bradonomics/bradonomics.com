- title: How to Sell Good Ideas
  quote: |
    [Gladwell] is more concerned that people find his work stimulating. [He] respects science, but isn't reverent of it, which drives some scientists crazy. But there is an important role for writers who speculate, make unusual connections, and even push things too far from time to time. Non-scientists have something valuable to offer science itself, not least cultural currency; whether the "10,000-hour rule" is right or not, the debates it inspired have deepened our collective understanding of high achievers.

- title: How to Write a Book
  quote: |
    In writing a book, you're going to find all sorts of interesting ways to mentally beat yourself up. You're going to consider new tools and different writing schedules. You'll discover that inspiration can be encouraged, but never created. You're going to find constructive ways to procrastinate and your friends are going to stop talking to you because all you talk about is that damned book.

- title: Writing Books is Not A Good Idea
  quote: |
    The New York Times caused a stir recently when, in [an article about pandemic book sales](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/18/books/book-sales-publishing-pandemic-coronavirus.html), it disclosed that "98 percent of the books that publishers released in 2020 sold fewer than 5,000 copies."

    Though this statistic was shocking to many, it is not new information. People don't read books—and the ones that do aren't buying them.

- title: Rediscovering the Small Web
  quote: |
    Most websites today are built like commercial products by professionals and marketers, optimised to draw the largest audience, generate engagement, and "convert." But there is also a smaller, less-visible web designed by regular people to simply to share their interests and hobbies with the world. A web that is unpolished, often quirky but often also fun, creative, and interesting.

  quote: |
    [This isn't] about novels and plays and poems. And definitely not about great novels and plays and poems. It's pointless to tell people to write stuff like that. Even the ones who want to can't. And of course, most people don't even want to.

    [This] is different. It's books *anybody* could write.

  quote: |
    Dates didn't matter all that much. Content lasted longer; there was less of it. Older content remained in view, too, because the dominant metaphor was *table of contents* rather than *diary entry*.
