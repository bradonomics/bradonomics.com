  quote: |
    [T]he nut graph effectively undermined the lede by saying, *okay we've set a scene and told the beginning of what feels like a story but we're guessing that you are feeling a little lost now so let me explain to you what's to come.*

    The effect is akin to a joke you need to explain. If you need to explain it, it's because no one got it.

  quote: |
    It turns out that millions of people never actually needed to waste days of their lives sitting in traffic or pantomime "work" under managerial scrutiny eight hours a day. We learned that nurses, cashiers, truckers and delivery people actually ran the world and the rest of us were mostly useless supernumeraries.

  quote: |
    Sharing things you're learning or making is not prideful. People are drawn to other people in motion. People want to follow along, people want to learn things, people want to be a part of your journey. It's not bragging to say, "I've made a thing and I think it's cool!"

  quote: |
    I know a friend who visits McDonald's in every country he travels to. In doing so, he hopes that some nuance about each place will reveal itself, some nuance that lies in the difference between a McDonald's that serves nasi lemak burger and a McDonald's that serves McAloo tikki burger. The differences in the pedestrian, rather than the extraordinary, are more telling, right? I get it. I have a similar ritual: I go to Chinatown.

  quote: |
    The best newsletters read like horoscopes, you think they've been written specifically for you. This newsletter is ostensibly about freelancing. Except that's not really what it's about. It's actually about shame, guilt, ambition, loss and belonging. Messy emotions that everyone with a human heart can relate to.

    [Gladwell] is more concerned that people find his work stimulating. [He] respects science, but isn't reverent of it, which drives some scientists crazy. But there is an important role for writers who speculate, make unusual connections, and even push things too far from time to time. Non-scientists have something valuable to offer science itself, not least cultural currency; whether the "10,000-hour rule" is right or not, the debates it inspired have deepened our collective understanding of high achievers.

    In writing a book, you're going to find all sorts of interesting ways to mentally beat yourself up. You're going to consider new tools and different writing schedules.

    The New York Times caused a stir recently when, in [an article about pandemic book sales](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/18/books/book-sales-publishing-pandemic-coronavirus.html), it disclosed that "98 percent of the books that publishers released in 2020 sold fewer than 5,000 copies."

    Though this statistic was shocking to many, it is not new information. People don't read books—and the ones that do aren't buying them.

    Most websites today are built like commercial products by professionals and marketers, optimised to draw the largest audience, generate engagement, and "convert."

A web that is unpolished, often quirky but often also fun, creative, and interesting.
