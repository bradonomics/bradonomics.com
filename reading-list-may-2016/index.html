    <h1>Reading List — May 2016</h1>
  </header>

  <p>I just don’t find enough good stuff to write Reading List posts that often. That’s why it’s been a few years since I’ve written one. Below are seven books I rated above average in that time. Seven whole books. It is almost depressing that there are not more good books out there …or that there is no decent recommendation engine.</p>

<p>I read Bill Bryson’s <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/walk-in-the-woods/oclc/926879835"><em>A Walk in the Woods</em></a> a few years before and didn’t care for it, so I’m not sure what prompted me to pick up <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/in-a-sunburned-country-with-a-new-appendix-on-the-sydney-olympics/oclc/635271676"><em>In a Sunburned Country</em></a> but it was a great read.</p>

<p>After having so much fun with <em>In a Sunburned Country</em> and thinking about a pending trip back to the US, I decided to read Bryson’s <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/im-a-stranger-here-myself-notes-on-returning-to-america-after-twenty-years-away/oclc/915866829"><em>I’m a Stranger Here Myself</em></a>. Also highly recommended.</p>

<p>I’ve rekindled my interest in computing, and Linux specifically, in the last year or so and decided to read a few books on open-source software. Paul Graham’s <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/hackers-painters-big-ideas-from-the-computer-age/oclc/934323016"><em>Hackers &amp; Painters</em></a> was great. Most of his essays are available on <a href="http://paulgraham.com/articles.html">his blog</a> but I’d never read most of them. Graham writes in a way that is easy to understand even when the subject matter is complex.</p>

<p>Then there was Eric S. Raymond’s <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/cathedral-and-the-bazaar-musings-on-linux-and-open-source-by-an-accidental-revolutionary/oclc/1027047759"><em>The Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar</em></a>; a perennial hacker favorite. Raymond uses his tenure as the lead developer of Fetchmail to help you understand the thinking of an open-source hacker. If you only read one book about Linux and open-source software, make it this one.</p>

<p>After getting excited about programming after all these years I knew I’d need some exceptional focus. Cal Newport’s <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/deep-work-rules-for-focused-success-in-a-distracted-world/oclc/986975350"><em>Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World</em></a> covers just that and gives a decent overview of how you can implement deep work.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/selling-the-invisible-a-field-guide-to-modern-marketing/oclc/149066543"><em>Selling the Invisible</em></a> by Harry Beckwith had been on my Kindle for a while and, for a lot of people, software is just as “invisible” as services. I thought the overlap between running a service business and running a software business would make this worth reading, and it was.</p>

<p>Just in case you thought I haven’t read any fiction, Barry Eisler’s <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/graveyard-of-memories/oclc/861206917"><em>Graveyard of Memories</em></a> was great. I think it’ll be the last book in the John Rain series and that makes me a little sad.</p>

<p><strong>Update: July 2017:</strong> <br />
A new John Rain book, <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/zero-sum-a-john-rain-novel-book-9/oclc/1109785766"><em>Zero Sum</em></a>, was just published.</p>
