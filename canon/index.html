  <p>What follows is a collection of things that have shaped my thinking, things I email people, things I return to often. If you are familiar with a literary canon, it’s kinda like that.</p>

<h2 id="writing">Writing</h2>

<p>The best guide I’ve ever found to improve your writing is <em>On Writing Well</em> by William Zinsser. Stephen King’s <em>On Writing</em> does a good job of describing the literary life, but doesn’t give the details of craft like Zinsser.</p>

<p>Scott Adams, of Dilbert fame, has a great article titled “<a href="http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/06/the_day_you_bec.html">The Day You Became A Better Writer</a>.”</p>

<p>There is a thread on Quora regarding “<a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-tips-for-advanced-writers-How-do-you-push-your-writing-into-excellency-territory">tips for advanced writers</a>” which has some good advice on craft. The responses from <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-tips-for-advanced-writers-How-do-you-push-your-writing-into-excellency-territory/answer/Venkatesh-Rao">Venkatesh Rao</a> and <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-tips-for-advanced-writers-How-do-you-push-your-writing-into-excellency-territory/answer/Alexandra-Pell">Alexandra Pell</a> are especially interesting.</p>

<p>Also, <a href="http://jsomers.net/blog/dictionary">you’re probably using the wrong dictionary</a>.</p>

<h2 id="design">Design</h2>

<p>Design is how it functions, not how it looks—how it looks is called art.</p>

<h2 id="personal-finance--self-reliance">Personal Finance &amp; Self Reliance</h2>

<p><em>Your Money or Your Life</em> by Joe Dominguez &amp; Vicki Robin</p>

<p><em>How to Survive Without a Salary</em> by Charles Long</p>

<p><em>The Self-Sufficient Life and How to Live It</em> by John Seymour</p>

<h2 id="permaculture">Permaculture</h2>

<p>While <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Mollison">Bill Mollison</a> was the founder of Permaculture and author of <em>Permaculture: A Designers’ Manual</em>, it was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoff_Lawton">Geoff Lawton</a> who did more to popularize the system. Many of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoff_Lawton#Films">Lawton’s films</a> can be found on the web.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masanobu_Fukuoka">Masanobu Fukuoka</a>: while I’m not a big fan of his book <em>The One-Straw Revolution</em>, I very much like his ideas on natural farming.</p>

  <p>Building something interesting requires a surplus of time and money. Salaried jobs provide neither.</p>

<h2 id="art--craft">Art &amp; Craft</h2>

<p>By art I don’t mean paintings or drawings, but those things people do that make you feel good. Think of that time someone did something for you that was way beyond what was required. Think about how that made you feel. <em>That</em> is art and no one describes it better than Seth Godin in <em>Linchpin</em>.</p>
