This project was a marketing site and job board for a headhunting company based in Bangkok.

It required a custom post type for testimonials and a slider to display the testimonials on the "client" and "candidate" pages. It also required a ticker to display the company's clients.

The biggest coding challenge was the job board, which in itself is easy enough, but this one need taxonomies separate from WordPress's existing taxonomies. I created a custom post type for Jobs and registered taxonomies for these posts. I then called posts with these taxonomies on the "candidate" page as a preview of different job types:
