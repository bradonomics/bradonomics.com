I was recently at Barcamp Bangkhen 3 in Bangkok and noticed that some people's Barcamp experience was better than others. I've been interested in networking for a while and have spent a lot of time reading about the practice and meeting with entrepreneurs to test what I've learned. I thought I'd give a few tips on networking as applied to Barcamp.

## Host a Talk

I've been to a couple of Barcamps before but this one was the first time I'd spoke. It changed everything. Before my talk no one approached me that I didn't already know, but after my talk people I didn't know were coming to me the rest of the day. Some people wanted to clarify something I'd said but a lot of people just wanted to know me more.

Don't be the guy who says they've got nothing to talk about. Everyone has something they could speak on. You don't have to be an expert on the topic you choose, you've just got to be further down the path than the people listening. I gave my talk on language learning. I couldn't have given this talk to a crowd of linguistics professors but I knew more about language learning than most people in the room, and that's enough.

## Don't Speak on Tech

A lot of people think [Barcamps are all about technology](http://ragle.sanukcode.net/articles/bar-camp/). And while the talks do tend toward tech, I think you should do something else. After people have sat through six talks about iOS vs Android, the latest development in Ruby on Rails and everything else on tech, they're going to want a break. My talk was the only one not on tech or startups and one dude said mine was the best talk of the day. Maybe it was, maybe it wasn't, but he remembered it because it was different.

## Bring Enough Name Cards

Even if you don't have a business, get cards printed with your name, telephone number, email and website. Leave the box open at the front or by the door during your talk so people can get a card without having to ask you. Some people will be too shy to ask for a card but will still want to connect with you after the event. Some people will want to talk with you but you'll be engaged with someone else and they won't want to wait. Having enough cards and leaving them so everyone can get one will ensure you have a lot of new connections after the event.

## Stay Till the End

90% of the name cards I got were given to me in the last hour of the event. People like to build rapport during the event and save “hey, send me an email sometime” for the end. If you leave early you'll miss a lot of new connections.
