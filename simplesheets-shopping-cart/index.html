  <p>SimpleSheets came to be after a conversation with Dr. Michael Shafer, the founder of <a href="http://warmheartworldwide.org/">Warm Heart</a>, a non-profit foundation in Thailand. He said that many of the people his foundation was meant to help were having a hard time selling their wares. He said WooCommerce was “too much system” for these people as they had little schooling and even less computer skills.</p>

<p><a href="http://chriszarate.github.io/sheetrock/">Sheetrock.js</a> is used to fetch the products from a Google Spreadsheet and <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars.js</a> is used to display them inside the HTML document. <a href="simpleCart&lt;sup&gt;(js)&lt;/sup&gt;">simpleCart<sup>(js)</sup></a> is the eCommerce engine and does all the heavy lifting.</p>
