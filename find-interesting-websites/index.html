    <h1>How I Find Interesting Websites</h1>
  </header>

  <p>I emailed a link to a friend which prompted him to ask “how do you find so many interesting things on the internet?”</p>

<p>I start with curated newsletters. My favorite is <a href="https://hackernewsletter.com/">Hacker Newsletter</a>. Emily Ding’s <a href="https://movableworlds.co/s/landmarkings/archive">Landmarkings</a> is good. So is Austin Kleon’s <a href="https://austinkleon.substack.com/archive">10 things worth sharing this week</a>.</p>

<p>The flow looks like this:</p>

<p>If there is a <a href="https://nownownow.com/about">Now page</a>, I read it. If there is an About page, I read it. If there is a Start Here page, I read it. After that I visit the homepage. What I’m looking for is someone who looks to be publishing interesting things. If I find a couple articles that look promising, I’ll save them to read later. If those articles prove to be interesting, I’ll add the site to my <a href="/web-feeds/">RSS reader</a>.</p>

<p>An example from a recent sleuthing: <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/">Gergely Orosz</a> has written a blog since 2015; he’s authored three books; he <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/coming-soon">started a newsletter</a> in 2021. I wanted to find if Greg had written anything about the publishing of his books. I started with this google search <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">site:blog.pragmaticengineer.com writing books</code>. That lead me to his article called <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/on-writing-well/">Undervalued Software Engineering Skills: Writing Well</a>. In that article he linked to a <a href="https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1353661833236926470">tweet</a> where he listed a few authors talking about writing.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://alexnixon.github.io/2019/12/10/writing.html">It’s time to start writing</a> by Alex Nixon</li>
  <li><a href="https://blog.stephsmith.io/learning-to-write-with-confidence/">Writing is Thinking</a> by Steph Smith</li>
  <li><a href="https://boz.com/articles/writing-thinking">Writing Is Thinking</a> by Andrew Bosworth</li>
</ul>

<p>I didn’t find what I was looking for on Greg’s site, but I did find three new blogs to read.</p>
