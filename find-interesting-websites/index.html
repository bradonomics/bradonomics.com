      <p>Note: this document is a draft and may make no sense.</p>
      <p>I started working on this September 16, 2021.</p>

  <p>I start with curated newsletters. My favorite is <a href="https://hackernewsletter.com/">Hacker Newsletter</a>. Sometimes I’m doing a search and find something interesting. Sometimes it’s links in an article from a writer I already follow.</p>

<p>The flow basically looks like this:</p>

<p>If there is a Now page, I read the Now page. If there is an About page, I read the About page. If there is a Start Here page, I read the Start Here page. After that I visit the homepage.</p>

<p>What I’m looking for is more than one article that looks good. If I find three or four that look interesting, I’ll probably add the site to my RSS reader.</p>

<p>An example from a recent sleuthing: <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/">Gerg Orosz</a> has written a blog for about six years, he’s authored three books, and recently <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/coming-soon">started a newsletter</a>. I wanted to find if Greg had written anything about the publishing of his books. I started with this google search <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">site:blog.pragmaticengineer.com writing books</code>. That lead me to his article called <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/on-writing-well/">Undervalued Software Engineering Skills: Writing Well</a>. In that article he linked to a tweet where he listed a few authors talking about writing.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://alexnixon.github.io/2019/12/10/writing.html">It’s time to start writing</a> by Alex Nixon</li>
  <li><a href="https://blog.stephsmith.io/learning-to-write-with-confidence/">Writing is Thinking</a> by Steph Smith</li>
  <li><a href="https://boz.com/articles/writing-thinking">Writing Is Thinking</a> by Andrew Bosworth</li>
</ul>

<p>I didn’t find what I was looking for on Greg’s site, but I did fine three new blogs that might find a home in my <a href="/web-feeds/">RSS reader</a>.</p>
