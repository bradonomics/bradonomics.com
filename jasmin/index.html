It’s mostly a teaser; somethings to think about and some links.</p><h2 id="brazilian-jiu-jitsu-a-little-background">Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, A Little Background</h2><p>Back in the day (70’s &amp; 80’s) there was a lot of debate about which style was the best and who would win if a karate master fought a kickboxer or if a Judo master fought a kung fu master. Well, the first UFC event set out to prove what style was best; in a style-vs-style tournament. Most guys that entered the show were 200+ pounds and black belts in their style.</p><p>Along comes the Gracie family and Royce Gracie. Royce was about 175 pounds; he was the lightest guy in the tournament. His first opponent was Art Jimmerson, a top level boxer at the time. Royce submitted him in just over two minutes. Next up was Ken Shamrock, a top level submission fighter in Japan. Royce choked him out in less than one minute. In the finals his opponent was Gerard Gordeau, a 6’5, 215 pound street fighter, karate black belt, and champion kickboxer from Holland. Royce submitted him in 1:44 wining the first UFC and proving if you couldn’t fight on the ground, you couldn’t fight.</p><p>Many people thought the first show as a fluke so when UFC 2 came around about a year later everyone was chomping at the bit to see if Royce would be able to defend his title. Not only did he defend it he had to fight 4 guys in this second show instead of the 3 in the previous tournament. He went on to win UFC 3 and UFC 4 all against larger opponents.</p><h2 id="jiu-jitsu-philosophy">Jiu-Jitsu Philosophy</h2><iframe width="853" height="480" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLU1y3cpgUxo7TRV7fK0u-r0t1-6KOboBF" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>Just in case you can’t see the whole playlist, you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLU1y3cpgUxo7TRV7fK0u-r0t1-6KOboBF&amp;v=4CGYQjC6WOY">click here to view it on YouTube</a>.</p><h2 id="wrestling-and-perseverance">Wrestling and Perseverance</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/270425">Why Wrestlers Make the Best Entrepreneurs</a></li><li><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevecooper/2012/07/31/why-wrestlers-make-the-best-employees/">Why Wrestlers Make the Best Employees</a></li></ul><h2 id="gracie-bullyproof">Gracie Bullyproof</h2><iframe width="853" height="480" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ybQ__WdAqvE?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></article></main></div><footer class="site-footer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/WPFooter"><p class="copyright">Copyright &copy; 2018</p><p class="contact">brad@bradonomics.com</p></footer><script src="https://bradonomics.com/js/jquery-2.2.4.min.js"></script> <script src="https://bradonomics.com/js/jquery.fitvids.js"></script> <script> $(document).ready(function(){ $(".entry-content").fitVids(); }); </script></body></html>
