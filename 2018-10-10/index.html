  <p>How do you find interesting things on the web?</p>

<p>If you are old enough to remember the web before Google, you may remember how people used to run their own websites. They might publish interesting articles themselves, but they’d also include links to things they found and often would keep a blogroll. The good stuff would bubble to the top.</p>

<p>Three things have happened in the meanwhile:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Google weponized links.</li>
  <li>Content farms have been busy filling the web with spam.</li>
  <li>Big Social and everything that comes with that.</li>
</ol>

<p>In light of this, I’d like to propose three things. First, create a blogroll and/or a canon on your personal site. Next, delete your social profiles. Don’t worry, you won’t become friendless and estranged from your family. Then, to fill the void, setup a feed reader with sites you actually like. If you are unfamiliar with feed readers, checkout <a href="https://www.youneedfeeds.com/">youneedfeeds.com</a> for more information.</p>

<p>You’re welcome.</p>
