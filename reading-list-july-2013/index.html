    <h1>Reading List — July 2013</h1>
  </header>

  <p>My introduction to Cal Newport’s book <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/so-good-they-cant-ignore-you-why-skills-trump-passion-in-the-quest-for-work-you-love/oclc/966671765"><em>So Good They Can’t Ignore You</em></a> was in a <em>Fast Company</em> article which <a href="https://bradonomics.com/follow-passion-useful-advice/">I wrote about here</a>. I’ve been interested to read the book since but just haven’t made time. I finally got a copy of the book and the <em>Fast Company</em> article does not do it justice. I wrote a review of the book; <a href="https://bradonomics.com/so-good-they-cant-ignore-you-book-review/">you can read it here</a>. Before you read my review I’ll preface it with this: if you’re struggling to find meaning in your work or looking for a new career, you need to read this book.</p>

<p>Since I was thinking about career trajectory and was riding a wave of motivation after reading Newport’s book, I decided to see what Steven Pressfield had to say in <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/turning-pro-tap-your-inner-power-and-create-your-lifes-work/oclc/798188052"><em>Turning Pro</em></a>. I was a little disappointed. <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/war-of-art-break-through-the-blocks-and-win-your-inner-creative-battles/oclc/955664049"><em>The War of Art</em></a> is a great book, and one I’d highly recommend, but <em>Turning Pro</em> seemed, at best, an addendum—<em>The War of Art, Revised and Updated</em> would have been better. If you’ve already read <em>The War of Art</em>, you can skip <em>Turning Pro</em>. If you’re deciding between the two, well…</p>

<p>Still in the mood to read about career theories and since it was just published, I read James Altucher’s <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/choose-yourself-be-happy-make-millions-live-the-dream/oclc/994829404"><em>Choose Yourself</em></a>. A lot of the book was republished blog articles. Not that this is a bad thing. I hadn’t read them on his blog and I only noticed after I had read the book. The main premise of the book is to follow a “health” regimentation focusing on four areas: mental, spiritual, physical and emotional. I think it’s easy enough to learn the ideas on <a href="http://www.jamesaltucher.com/2013/01/finding-your-goal-and-purpose-in-life/">his blog</a> and wouldn’t recommend the book.</p>

<p>After two failed attempts to read different career theories and being disappointed, I thought I’d read Dan Pink’s <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/drive-the-surprising-truth-about-what-motivates-us/oclc/1082864831"><em>Drive</em></a>. Newport referenced it many times in <em>So Good They Can’t Ignore You</em> and I thought it would be best to see where the research came from. It was a great follow-up to Newport’s book. In fact, I’d go so far as to say Newport took Pink’s research and molded it into a career advice book. That’s not to say Newport stole the ideas. Newport first wrote about what would become Career Capital Theory a year or so before <em>Drive</em> was published. But <em>Drive</em> gave him the research on motivation he needed to round-out his theory. If you’re interested in intrinsic motivation theories, <em>Drive</em> will be a good read. But you’ll probably want to start at the back. In “Part Three,” he gives an overview; the theories and some thoughts on applying them.</p>

<p>I heard good things about the meta-learning sections of Tim Ferriss’ <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/4-hour-chef-the-simple-path-to-cooking-like-a-pro-learning-anything-and-living-the-good-life/oclc/1089931549"><em>4-Hour Chef</em></a> and decided to give it a try. I skimmed mostly since I wasn’t interested in learning to cook but the parts of the book about how to learn skills quickly was very interesting. It’s a massive book and, what little I read in the section, gives a great introduction to cooking. He puts structure behind cooking so as not to intimidate the reader. It’s likely I’ll buy a hardback version to keep as reference for his ideas on meta-learning.</p>
