    <h1>Jekyll vs WordPress, a Speed Comparison</h1>
  </header>

  <p>WordPress has long been thought of as the weak option for content management on the web. Developers are often telling clients how Drupal is much more powerful, robust, and secure; or they’re pitching some custom built solution. Then you’ve got the WordPress crowd trying to defend their position claiming that “WordPress is more than just a blogging platform.” Well, I’m about to flip that on its head. I spend a lot of time on the internet—I’ve got my 10,000 hours if you know what I mean—and I’d say WordPress is too much system for a majority of websites.</p>

<p>I’ve long thought static websites are faster, safer, and cheaper. In this article we’ll look at some data concerning speed differences between the two systems and see if I’m right.</p>

<p>First, let me explain how I came to use static pages and static site generators. In 2014 I was told about a private forum post where the author claimed to rank websites in Google without backlinks. He said by having a super fast website and following a few other directives, he was routinely ranking for difficult keywords without a single backlink. I decided to test this and recreated my WordPress site using only static HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I never saw any significant SERP movement and while I did like the speed of the site, I didn’t like the difficulty of updating something like a menu item or the footer—things that were on every page. That’s when I went searching for a static website generator. I decided on Jekyll but there are many generators and all of them have the same end result: a set of static HTML files. I use “Jekyll” in the descriptions below but just substitute “static” or your preferred generator if you don’t want to use Jekyll.</p>

<p>To test the difference in speed between WordPress and Jekyll, I set up two sites on an unimpressive shared hosting account. I added a large amount of text and a number of pictures to a post to have some data to work with. Once the pages were loaded with the same data I used <a href="https://gtmetrix.com/">GTmetrix</a> and <a href="http://www.webpagetest.org/">WebPagetest.org</a> to test the sites.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://gtmetrix.com/reports/demo.bradonomics.com/0bYcDCXc">GTmetrix test of the WordPress site</a> showed a page load time of 3.7 seconds. That’s not bad—better than most according to Google’s data. The <a href="https://gtmetrix.com/reports/demo.bradonomics.com/RbLv2xkO">GTmetrix test of the Jekyll generated site</a> showed a page load time of 1.4 seconds. That’s 2.3 seconds faster or 164%. The PageSpeed Grade was 35% better and the YSlow grade was 8% better with the static site.</p>

  <figcaption>I loaded the same content in a WordPress install and a Jekyll install, then ran the numbers.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>WebPagetest.org runs the site twice giving you a better idea of what a first time visitor would see and what a repeat visitor would see once your site has been cached. Here are the numbers:</p>

<figure class="caption">
  <a href="/images/webpagetest-wordpress.jpg"><img src="/images/webpagetest-wordpress.jpg" alt="WordPress test on webpagetest.org" /></a>
  <figcaption>First View: 19.625s; Repeat View: 5.607s. <a href="http://www.webpagetest.org/result/160514_A2_CJM/">Full test results here</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure class="caption">
  <a href="/images/webpagetest-jekyll.jpg"><img src="/images/webpagetest-jekyll.jpg" alt="Jekyll test on webpagetest.org" /></a>
  <figcaption>First View: 10.791s; Repeat View: 2.942s. <a href="http://www.webpagetest.org/result/160514_XJ_CKT/">Full test results here</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Quite a bit different. The page load time is still faster with the static site—82% faster—but WebPagetest.org is showing a longer load time than GTmetrix.</p>

<p>For me, the decision to go with a static site generator is pretty obvious. The only question then is: do you need a database? The answer is <em>no</em> more often than you’d think, and if you can say no to the database I think you should. You’ll get more speed, more security, and less complexity, all of which should save you money.</p>

<p>If you’re intereseted in building your website using a static generator, please get in touch, I’d be happy to help.</p>
