  <p>Are you old enough to remember blogrolls? They used to be popular and I think they should be again. I use an <a href="https://bradonomics.com/2018-10-10/">feed reader</a> to keep up with the bloggers I like. If you do not, you should probably look into that.</p>

<p>If you have a blog you think I’d like, you should email me. I promise to read at least one article. If I like it enough I’ll subscribe. And maybe I’ll link to it here.</p>

<h2 id="newsletters">Newsletters</h2>

<p>It is hard to find good stuff on the web these days. As much as I like blogs, a curated newsletter can find those one-off articles that are really good without having to slog through a generally bad blog yourself. On occasion a good newsletter can introduce you to a good blog.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.hackernewsletter.com/">Hacker Newsletter</a>: Some of the stuff on Hacker News is great but who has the time to look through it all? Hacker Newsletter sends me the best-of-the-best every Friday.</p>

<p><del><a href="https://austinkleon.com/newsletter/">Austin Kleon</a>: Austin is a “daily blogger.” Who has that much interesting stuff to say? Nobody I’ve ever seen. Austin does do a good job curating and also adds his best of the week. No slogging required.</del> I unsubscribed October 2019 as very little in this is interesting to me anymore. Not sure if I’ve changed or if Austin has changed, but whatever the case, I’m out.</p>
