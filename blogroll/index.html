  <p>Are you old enough to remember blogrolls? They used to be popular and I think they should be again. Below are a few I read regularly, but first some commentary:</p>

<p>I use an feed reader to keep up with the bloggers I like. If you don’t, you should probably look into that. I have a general rule for blogs that get added to my reader: one-in-four. Some bloggers will write article after article on topics I don’t find interesting, but then one day—wam—an article that knocks my socks off. No blog is perfect, and no blogger is perfect. Even the greats among us roll a gutter ball every now and then, but if you can’t hit one out of four you won’t last long in my reader.</p>

<p>If you have a blog you think I’d like, you should email me. I promise to read at least one article. If I like it enough I’ll subscribe and if it passes the aforementioned test, I’ll link to it here.</p>

<p>It is hard to find good stuff on the web these days. As much as I like blogs, a curated newsletter can find those one-off articles that are really good without having to slog through a generally bad blog yourself. On occasion a good newsletter can introduce you to a good blog.</p>
