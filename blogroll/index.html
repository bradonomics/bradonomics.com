  <p>Are you old enough to remember blogrolls? They used to be popular and I think they should be again. I use a <a href="https://bradonomics.com/web-feeds/">feed reader</a> to keep up with the bloggers I like. If you do not, you should probably look into that.</p>

<p>If you have a blog you think I’d like, you should email me. I promise to read at least one article. If I like it enough I’ll subscribe, and maybe I’ll link to it here.</p>

<p>A note about Newsletters: You’ll notice a few of the “blogs” below are hosted on Substack. Most people would call these newsletters and not blogs. My take: if it has an RSS feed, it’s a blog.</p>
