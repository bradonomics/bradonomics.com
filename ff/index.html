    <h1>Friends and Family Email List</h1>
  </header>

  <p>When I first heard of social media I thought it was ridiculous. Then I moved to Thailand and every social outing was organized on Facebook. It was actually cool for a year or two, an interesting way to keep up with people. But after a while it started to feel like a chore. It was either overload, people posting everything they ate and everything they did, or it was <em>crafted</em>. It started to get depressing, not only because it looked like everyone was on vacation but me, but also because I wasn’t keeping up with my friends anymore. Facebook wasn’t providing me the very thing I signed up to do.</p>

<p>I’d rather talk to you in person, but since I know people all over the place, that’s impractical. Phone calls would be a good option but time zones can be difficult. So my solution is email. I’m using a program designed for newsletters to help manage this, but it’s just me sending emails to you. Two or three times per year when interesting things happen. My hope is we’ll connect again, the way we did in those early years of Facebook. I hope you’ll reply and tell me what you’ve been up to.</p>
