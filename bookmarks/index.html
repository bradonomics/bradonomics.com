    <blockquote><p>Ikigai is a solid concept, but it’s not realistic. Finding that cross section would take a long-ass time. Try doing the “what you can be paid for” section first, and the rest will take care of itself.</p>

    <blockquote><p>It turns out that millions of people never actually needed to waste days of their lives sitting in traffic or pantomime “work” under managerial scrutiny eight hours a day. We learned that nurses, cashiers, truckers and delivery people actually ran the world and the rest of us were mostly useless supernumeraries.</p>

    <blockquote><p>Sharing things you’re learning or making is not prideful. People are drawn to other people in motion. People want to follow along, people want to learn things, people want to be a part of your journey. It’s not bragging to say, “I’ve made a thing and I think it’s cool!”</p>

    <blockquote><p>I know a friend who visits McDonald’s in every country he travels to. In doing so, he hopes that some nuance about each place will reveal itself, some nuance that lies in the difference between a McDonald’s that serves nasi lemak burger and a McDonald’s that serves McAloo tikki burger. The differences in the pedestrian, rather than the extraordinary, are more telling, right? I get it. I have a similar ritual: I go to Chinatown.</p>

    <p class="post-title"><a href="https://annacodrearado.substack.com/p/what-ive-learned-growing-a-newsletter">What I've learned growing a newsletter to 15,000 readers</a></p>
    <blockquote><p>The best newsletters read like horoscopes, you think they’ve been written specifically for you. This newsletter is ostensibly about freelancing. Except that’s not really what it’s about. It’s actually about shame, guilt, ambition, loss and belonging. Messy emotions that everyone with a human heart can relate to.</p>

    <blockquote><p>I’d like to emphasize is that I did not have a large online platform to start with. Yet I didn’t have no platform either. I had a middling platform, which was, in retrospect, basically the minimum one necessary.</p>

    <p class="post-title"><a href="https://erikhoel.substack.com/p/writing-for-outlets-isnt-worth-it">Writing for outlets isn't worth it anymore</a></p>
    <blockquote><p>The amount of work it takes to actually get something published vastly outstrips that of writing it. This iron law of freelance writing is indubitable and unchangeable. You don’t just have to write a piece, you also have to pitch it.</p>

    <blockquote><p>I publicly commit to simplifying my language at work. I commit to saying <em>use</em> instead of <em>leverage</em>, to avoid using <em>action</em> as a verb or <em>ask</em> as a noun, and to offer to send a follow-up email rather than to <em>align async</em>.</p>

    <blockquote><p>[Gladwell] is more concerned that people find his work stimulating. [He] respects science, but isn’t reverent of it, which drives some scientists crazy. But there is an important role for writers who speculate, make unusual connections, and even push things too far from time to time. Non-scientists have something valuable to offer science itself, not least cultural currency; whether the “10,000-hour rule” is right or not, the debates it inspired have deepened our collective understanding of high achievers.</p>

    <blockquote><p>In writing a book, you’re going to find all sorts of interesting ways to mentally beat yourself up. You’re going to consider new tools and different writing schedules. You’ll discover that inspiration can be encouraged, but never created. You’re going to find constructive ways to procrastinate and your friends are going to stop talking to you because all you talk about is that damned book.</p>

    <p class="post-title"><a href="https://ellegriffin.substack.com/p/creator-economy-for-fiction-authors">Writing Books is Not A Good Idea</a></p>
    <blockquote><p>The New York Times caused a stir recently when, in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/18/books/book-sales-publishing-pandemic-coronavirus.html">an article about pandemic book sales</a>, it disclosed that “98 percent of the books that publishers released in 2020 sold fewer than 5,000 copies.”</p>

<p>Though this statistic was shocking to many, it is not new information. People don’t read books—and the ones that do aren’t buying them.</p>

    <blockquote><p>Most websites today are built like commercial products by professionals and marketers, optimised to draw the largest audience, generate engagement, and “convert.” But there is also a smaller, less-visible web designed by regular people to simply to share their interests and hobbies with the world. A web that is unpolished, often quirky but often also fun, creative, and interesting.</p>

    <blockquote><p>[This isn’t] about novels and plays and poems. And definitely not about great novels and plays and poems. It’s pointless to tell people to write stuff like that. Even the ones who want to can’t. And of course, most people don’t even want to.</p>

    <blockquote><p>But here’s the twist: my boyfriend <em>loved</em> me in my cheap extensions. Regardless of how artificial they looked, they still gave a decent first impression, and the straight male mind seems to cling to whatever imprint it originally receives. So I looked way hotter, all the time, and I often wore pigtails because I never knew what the hell else to do with it. Pigtails, we all know, are like a dog whistle for penises.</p>

    <blockquote><p>You can look at Google’s entire portfolio of launches over the past decade, and trace nearly all of them to copying a competitor […]. They are stuck in me-too mode and have been for years. They simply don’t have innovation in their DNA any more. And it’s because their eyes are fixed on their competitors, not their customers.</p>
