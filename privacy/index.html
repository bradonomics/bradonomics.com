<p>You want to assume you’re being scammed and/or ripped-off at all times while on this website, that you have no privacy while here, and that the authors, sponsors, or anyone affiliated with this website are not responsible in any way, for anything.</p>

<h2>FTC Compliance Notice</h2>

<p>To comply with America’s Federal Trade Commission regulations, I’ve got to tell you that I might make money from this website. So to that end: assume that if I interview someone, they have a financial interest in me or I have a financial interest in them. Assume any links are affiliate links or advertisements. Assume if I’m in a photo wearing a t-shirt with a logo, that someone paid me to wear it. Assume if I recommend a service or product someone paid me to do so.</p>

<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>Note that this is a website and, as such, acts no different than most other websites. I have chosen not to collect data or track your visits using third-party analytics software. That doesn’t mean that the servers hosting the code can’t see your IP address—in the case of this website, it would be <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a>. If this is news to you, may I recommend some reading at <a href="https://www.privacyguides.org/">PrivacyGuides.org</a>.</p>

<h2>A Note for Lawyers</h2>

<p>I know how you and your ilk like convoluted prose written in uppercase. Here you go:</p>
