I'm working as a backend developer at an agency in Atlanta called Nebo. I haven't been on the jiu-jitsu mats since pre-COVID. I crashed my bike back in the summer and injured my wrist. I was out of the saddle for about a month. After healing I did my first over-night cycling trip. 100 miles over two days along the Chief Ladiga and Silver Comet Trails.
