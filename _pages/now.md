I'm back in the States and looking for work. I'd prefer to work with Jekyll, but WordPress is cool too. I'm looking for a remote position so I can stay in Alabama with my family. If you know anyone looking for a developer with an eclectic skill set, send them to my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brad-west-a0baab31) or if they're old school, pass them [my PDF resume](/brad-west-v5.4.pdf).
