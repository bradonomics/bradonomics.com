## Work

- Took a six-month contract to work with Leidos building the [Health Resources and Services Administration's Telehealth website](https://telehealth.hhs.gov/).
- I started learning Ruby on Rails about a year ago. Last November I started building [Portholes](https://portholes.app/), an alternative to [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/).
- Still trying to decide if I want to put effort into a web agency; and if so, what products or services to offer.

## Cycling

I started cycling in the summer of 2017, mostly to rehab my knee after surgery. After my knee was stronger, I returned to jiu-jitsu the following summer and continued riding as a way of increasing my cardiovascular fitness. Those rides were about 4 miles. In the summer of 2020, COVID kept me off the jiu-jitsu mats so I started longer rides---about 10 miles. The longer rides have continued this summer.

## Reading Recommendations

I have long believed that book recommendations is an unsolvable problem. [StoryGraph](https://www.thestorygraph.com/) is taking a stab at it and looks promising.
