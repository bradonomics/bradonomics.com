I'm back in the States and looking for work. I'd prefer to continue working as a web developer, or some type of software developer. Although a network or systems admin position could be interesting. If you know anyone looking for a developer with an eclectic skill set, send them to my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brad-west-a0baab31) or if they're old school, pass them [my PDF resume](/brad-west-v6.pdf).
