I'm looking for work---a full time position. I'd prefer back-end development work with Python or even a Linux System Admin position. My experience in both those is minimal so it'd probably be a junior role. That's not to say I've turned my back on WordPress and Jekyll, I'd gladly take a position working with these. If you know anyone looking for a developer with an eclectic skill set, send them to my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brad-west-a0baab31) or if they're old school, pass them [my PDF resume](/brad-west-v5.2.pdf).
