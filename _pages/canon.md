## Writing

The best guide I've ever found to improve your writing is [_On Writing Well_](https://www.worldcat.org/title/on-writing-well-the-classic-guide-to-writing-nonfiction/oclc/958366043) by William Zinsser.

Scott Adams, of Dilbert fame, has a great article titled "[The Day You Became A Better Writer](http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/06/the_day_you_bec.html)."

  <p>All of the action on the page, everything that happens, happens in the verbs. Bad verb choices mean adverbs. More often than not, you don't need them. Did he run quickly or did he sprint? Did he walk slowly or did he stroll or saunter?"</p>

There is a thread on Quora regarding "[tips for advanced writers](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-tips-for-advanced-writers-How-do-you-push-your-writing-into-excellency-territory)" which has some good advice on craft. The responses from [Venkatesh Rao](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-tips-for-advanced-writers-How-do-you-push-your-writing-into-excellency-territory/answer/Venkatesh-Rao) and [Alexandra Pell](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-tips-for-advanced-writers-How-do-you-push-your-writing-into-excellency-territory/answer/Alexandra-Pell) are especially interesting.

## Design

Design is how it functions, not how it looks---how it looks is called art.

## Permaculture

While [Bill Mollison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Mollison) was the founder of Permaculture and author of _Permaculture: A Designers' Manual_, it was [Geoff Lawton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoff_Lawton) who did more to popularize the system. Many of [Lawton's films](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoff_Lawton#Films) can be found on the web.

## Art & Craft

By art I don't mean paintings or drawings, but those things people do that make you feel good. Think of that time someone did something for you that was way beyond what was required. Think about how that made you feel. _That_ is art and no one describes it better than Seth Godin in [_Linchpin_](https://www.worldcat.org/title/linchpin-are-you-indispensable/oclc/1022214502).
