## Writing

The best guide I've ever found to improve your writing is _On Writing Well_ by William Zinsser.

Scott Adams, of Dilbert fame, has a great article titled "[The Day You Became A Better Writer](http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/06/the_day_you_bec.html)."

There is a thread on Quora regarding "[tips for advanced writers](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-tips-for-advanced-writers-How-do-you-push-your-writing-into-excellency-territory)" which has some good advice on craft. The responses from [Venkatesh Rao](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-tips-for-advanced-writers-How-do-you-push-your-writing-into-excellency-territory/answer/Venkatesh-Rao) and [Alexandra Pell](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-tips-for-advanced-writers-How-do-you-push-your-writing-into-excellency-territory/answer/Alexandra-Pell) are especially interesting.

Also, [you're probably using the wrong dictionary](http://jsomers.net/blog/dictionary).

## Design

Design is how it functions, not how it looks---how it looks is called art.

## Permaculture

While [Bill Mollison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Mollison) was the founder of Permaculture and author of _Permaculture: A Designers' Manual_, it was [Geoff Lawton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoff_Lawton) who did more to popularize the system. Many of [Lawton's films](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoff_Lawton#Films) can be found on the web.

[Garbage Warrior](http://www.garbagewarrior.com/): a documentery about architect Michael Reynolds and his house designs.

[One Man, One Cow, One Planet](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1201582/): a documentery about farming in India and a man from New Zealand teaching Biodynamic agriculture methods.

[Masanobu Fukuoka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masanobu_Fukuoka): while I'm not a big fan of his book _The One-Straw Revolution_, I very much like his ideas on natural farming.

## Business

  <p>Building something interesting requires a surplus of time and money. Salaried jobs provide neither.</p>

## Art & Craft

By art I don't mean paintings or drawings, but those things people do that make you feel good. Think of that time someone did something for you that was way beyond what was required. Think about how that made you feel. _That_ is art and no one describes it better than Seth Godin in _Linchpin_.
