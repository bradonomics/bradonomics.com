What follows is a collection of things that have shaped my thinking, things I email people, things I return to often. If you are familiar with a literary canon, it's kinda like that.

## Writing

The best guide I've ever found to improve your writing is _On Writing Well_ by William Zinsser. Stephen King's _On Writing_ does a good job of describing the literary life, but doesn't give the details of craft like Zinsser.

Scott Adams, of Dilbert fame, has a great article titled "[The Day You Became A Better Writer](http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/06/the_day_you_bec.html)."

There is a thread on Quora regarding "[tips for advanced writers](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-tips-for-advanced-writers-How-do-you-push-your-writing-into-excellency-territory)" which has some good advice on craft. The responses from [Venkatesh Rao](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-tips-for-advanced-writers-How-do-you-push-your-writing-into-excellency-territory/answer/Venkatesh-Rao) and [Alexandra Pell](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-tips-for-advanced-writers-How-do-you-push-your-writing-into-excellency-territory/answer/Alexandra-Pell) are especially interesting.

## Personal Finance & Self Reliance

_Your Money or Your Life_ by Joe Dominguez & Vicki Robin

_How to Survive Without a Salary_ by Charles Long

_The Self-Sufficient Life and How to Live It_ by John Seymour

## Permaculture

While [Bill Mollison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Mollison) was the founder of Permaculture and author of _Permaculture: A Designers' Manual_, it was [Geoff Lawton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoff_Lawton) who did more to popularize the system. Many of [his films](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoff_Lawton#Films) can be found on the web.

[Garbage Warrior](http://www.garbagewarrior.com/): a documentery about architect Michael Reynolds and his house designs.

[One Man, One Cow, One Planet](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1201582/): a documentery about farming in India and a man from New Zealand teaching [Biodynamic agriculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodynamic_agriculture) methods.

[Masanobu Fukuoka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masanobu_Fukuoka): while I'm not a big fan of his book _The One-Straw Revolution_, I very much like his ideas on natural farming.

## Business

_The 4-Hour Workweek_ by Tim Ferriss

_The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing_ by Al Ries & Jack Trout

"[Solitude and Leadership](https://theamericanscholar.org/solitude-and-leadership/)" by William Deresiewicz

## Design

[This is Broken by Seth Godin](https://www.ted.com/talks/seth_godin_this_is_broken_1)

## Art

By art I don't mean paintings or drawings, but those things people do that make you feel good. Think of that time someone did something for you that was way beyond what was required. Think about how that made you feel. _That_ is art and no one describes it better than Seth Godin in _Linchpin_.

## Artifacting

Craig Mod on [books, walks, and the edge of the world](https://medium.com/@craigmod/books-experiences-and-the-edges-of-our-world-4e18d1fb8e58).

Austin Kleon on [keeping a logbook](https://austinkleon.com/2010/01/31/logbook/) and how [diaries are evidence of our days](https://austinkleon.com/2017/11/29/evidence/).

## History

I wish there were better history books. I have no idea why, but most authors of history are incapable of good storytelling. Thankfully there are some good films like [Into the West](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Into_the_West_(miniseries)) and [John Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams_(miniseries)).

If you know of a good history book, email me the details.
