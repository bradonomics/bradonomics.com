## FTC Compliance Notice

To comply with America's Federal Trade Commission regulations I've got to tell you that I might make money from this site. So to that end: assume that if I interview someone they have a financial interest in me or I have a financial interest in them. Assume any links are affiliate links or advertisements. Assume if I'm in a photo wearing a t-shirt with a logo, that someone paid me to wear it. Assume if I recommend a service or product someone paid me to do so.

## Terms of Service

You want to assume you're being scammed and/or ripped-off at all times while on this website, that you have no privacy while here, and that the authors, sponsors, or anyone affiliated with this blog are not responsible in any way, for anything.

## Privacy Policy

Note that this is a website and as such acts no different than most other websites. I have chosen not to collect data for analytics purposes, but I might try to sell you stuff anyway. All articles, comments, and other musings are those of the article or comment author---as if that needed to be said.

As mentioned, I do not keep analytics data, log files, or otherwise track my visitors. This site is hosted with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and uses [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) for content distribution. If either of those services attach cookies or otherwise track you, that's on them. You can probably find their privacy and terms-of-service notices in their footers.

## Notes for Lawyers

If you are a lawyer you probably require a document that was written by a cohort using bastardized language only you can read. You can find those documents here: [Privacy Policy]({{ '/privacy-policy/' | absolute_url }}), [Terms of Service]({{ '/terms-of-service/' | absolute_url }}).
