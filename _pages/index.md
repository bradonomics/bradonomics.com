## About

I sling code for [Travel Tripper](http://www.traveltripper.com/solutions/hotel-websites/) as a member of their web agency team. I run a newsletter about Jekyll. It's called [Jekyll Weekly](https://jekyllweekly.com/) but almost never ships weekly. I've played Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu off-and-on since 2002. I lived in Thailand for eight years. I live on a cattle farm in rural Alabama.
