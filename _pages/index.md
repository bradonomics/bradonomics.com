## About

I sling code for [Travel Tripper](http://www.traveltripper.com/solutions/hotel-websites/) as a member of their web agency team. We build websites for hotels using JAMstack; mostly Jekyll. I also run a newsletter about Jekyll. It's called [Jekyll Weekly](https://jekyllweekly.com/) but almost never ships weekly. I'm also a sixth generation cattle farmer.

If you're interested in more about me, you can [read that here](/about/).

Random musings can be found on [my blog](/blog/).
