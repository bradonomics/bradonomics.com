**20 second version:**

I build web things for the web, professionally and for fun. I occasionally curate a [newsletter about Jekyll](https://jekyllweekly.com/). I started playing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu around 2002, took a ten year break, and am now back on the mat. In 2009 I moved to Thailand to attend university. After eight years in Thailand and 19 years total, I moved back to the family farm in rural Alabama.

## Blog

My blog comes in two parts. [Articles]({{ "/articles/" | absolute_url }}) are longer form---what you would expect from a blog, I suppose. [Notes]({{ "/notes/" | absolute_url }}) are shorter, something more like Twitter or Tumblr.

Below are a few of my favorite articles:

 - [The Randy Couture Story]({{ "/randy-couture-story/" | absolute_url }}){: .post-link }
 - [An Anti-Travel Story]({{ "/anti-travel/" | absolute_url }}){: .post-link }
 - [Too Stupid to Learn a Second Language?]({{ "/second-language/" | absolute_url }}){: .post-link }
 - [A New Business Model for Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu]({{ "/bjj-business-model/" | absolute_url }}){: .post-link }
