## My Writing

My writing comes in two forms. [Articles]({{ '/articles/' | absolute_url }}) are long form and written by me. The type of thing you'd expect from a blog, I suppose. [Notes]({{ '/notes/' | absolute_url }}) are shorter and not necessarily written by me, something more like Twitter or Tumblr.

Below are a few of my favorite articles:

 - [The Randy Couture Story]({{ '/randy-couture-story/' | absolute_url }})
 - [An Anti-Travel Story]({{ '/anti-travel/' | absolute_url }})
 - [Too Stupid to Learn a Second Language?]({{ '/second-language/' | absolute_url }})
 - [A New Business Model for Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu]({{ '/bjj-business-model/' | absolute_url }})
