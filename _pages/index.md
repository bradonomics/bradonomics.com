## My Writing

My writing comes in two forms. [Articles]({{ '/articles/' | absolute_url }}) are long form and written by me. The type of thing you'd expect from a blog, I suppose. [Notes]({{ '/notes/' | absolute_url }}) are shorter and not necessarily written by me, something more like Twitter or Tumblr.
