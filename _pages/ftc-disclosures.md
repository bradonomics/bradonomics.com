Per the Federal Trade Commission of the United States I have to disclose all relationships and/or offers that _might_ make me money. That means if I interview someone and they pay for lunch or give me schwag, I'd need to tell you. If I use an Amazon link that gets me 8 cents instead of an Amazon link that gets me 0 cents, I would need to tell you this also. If someone gives me a t-shirt with a logo, I'd need to tell you that someone gave it to me.

Disclaimers all over the place.

This would be tedious for me and a continual eye sore for you. So to cover my ass and preserve your reading and listening experience, please assume, for every recommendation, link and product I use or recommend, the following holds true:
