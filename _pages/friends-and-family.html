<p>I don't know what you're up to anymore. I doubt you know what I'm up to either. I want to remedy that. The only way I can think of is to keep everyone I care about on an email list. Then once or twice a year I can send an email. Something long enough to be meaningful. My hope is, that will start a conversation between us. Just me and you. No posturing for all the readers of our social media comments. Just me and you.</p>
