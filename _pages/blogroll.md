Are you old enough to remember blogrolls? They used to be quite popular and I think they should be again. Here are a few I read regularly, but first some commentary:

I use an RSS reader to keep up with the bloggers I like. If you don't, you should probably look in to that. I have a general rule for blogs that get added to my reader: one-in-four. Some bloggers will write post after post on topics I don't find interesting, but then one day---wam---an article that knocks my socks off. No blog is perfect, and no blogger is perfect. Even the greats among us roll a gutter ball every now and then, but if you can't hit one out of four you won't last long in my reader.

If you have a blog you think I'd like, you should email me. I promise to read at least one post. If I like it enough I'll subscribe and if it passes the aformentioned test, I'll link to it here.
