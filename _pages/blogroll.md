Are you old enough to remember blogrolls? They used to be popular and I think they should be again. I use an [feed reader]({{ "/2018-10-10/" | absolute_url }}) to keep up with the bloggers I like. If you do not, you should probably look into that.

If you have a blog you think I'd like, you should email me. I promise to read at least one article. If I like it enough I'll subscribe, I'll link to it here.

## Newsletters

It is hard to find good stuff on the web these days. As much as I like blogs, a curated newsletter can find those one-off articles that are really good without having to slog through a generally bad blog yourself. On occasion a good newsletter can introduce you to a good blog.

[Hacker Newsletter](https://www.hackernewsletter.com/): Some of the stuff on Hacker News is great but who has the time to look through it all? Hacker Newsletter sends me the best-of-the-best every Friday.

[Austin Kleon](https://austinkleon.com/newsletter/): Austin is a "daily blogger." Who has that much interesting stuff to say? Nobody I've ever seen. Austin does do a good job curating and also adds his best of the week. No slogging required.
