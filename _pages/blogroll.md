Are you old enough to remember blogrolls? They used to be popular and I think they should be again. I use a [feed reader]({{ "/web-feeds/" | absolute_url }}) to keep up with the bloggers I like. If you do not, you should probably look into that.

If you have a blog you think I'd like, you should email me. I promise to read at least one article. If I like it enough I'll subscribe, and maybe I'll link to it here.

A note about Newsletters: You'll notice a few of the "blogs" below are hosted on Substack. Most people would call these newsletters and not blogs. My take: if it has an RSS feed, it's a blog.

## Newsletters

It is hard to find good stuff on the web these days. As much as I like blogs, a curated newsletter can find those one-off articles that are really good without having to slog through post after post on a bad blog.

[**Hacker Newsletter**](https://hackernewsletter.com/): Some of the stuff on Hacker News is great but who has the time to look through it all? Hacker Newsletter sends me the best-of-the-best every Friday.
