<p>If you've ever wanted to watch over someone's shoulder while they build a business, you are in the right place.</p>

<p>For the next year I intend to write a monthly recap of building a tour company. I'll start from the very beginning—how we got the idea, incorporation, banking, marketing strategy, what we're doing, what is working, and what is not. If you'd like to follow along, add your email below. I've never built a business in public, and this might end in spectacular failure. I hope it won't. No matter what happens, I hope you'll join me.</p>
