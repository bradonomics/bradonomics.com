<p>Measuring (Analytics and Like Buttons)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you are writing in the absence of feedback you have to rely on your own judgment. You want to please your audience, of course. But to do that you have to imagine what your audience will like, and since that's hard, you end up leaning on what you like.</p>
  <p>Once other people start telling you what they like via Like buttons, you inevitably start hewing to their idea of what's good. And since "people tend to be extremely similar in their vulgar and prurient and dumb interests and wildly different in their refined and aesthetic and noble interests," the stuff you publish will start looking a lot like the stuff that everybody else publishes, because everybody sort of likes the same thing and everybody is fishing for Likes.</p>
